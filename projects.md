#Project Hightlights:


## Software Development Project Click [here](https://github.com/yadel23/Team-B1---Game.git) to go to the project.
### Description:
Built an object oriented java game, as a team with other developers.
This Game is similar to the 2D platform game Mario.
I enjoyed working in Scrum cycles and managing the git repository. This project thought me how to handle large amounts of code by debugging and carefully planning out tasks through scrum cycles. In addition it has also improved my communication skills that are needed in the tech industry when working with other tech developers.


## Data Structure and Abstraction Project Click [here](https://github.com/yadel23/MazeProject.git) to go to the project.
### Description:
Developed a text-based maze solver game using java. The maze solves using intensive recursive methods that search every path to find the way out. This project gave me better understanding of 2D arrays and how to unitize recursive algorithms. In addition it has thought me efficiency when debugging and refracturing code.
