I enjoyed working in Scrum cycles and managing the git repository. This project though me how to handle big projects by debugging and carefully planning out tasks through scrum cycles. In addition it has also built my communication skills that will help in the tech industry with working with other tech developers.

### Description:
Developed a text-based maze solver game using java. The maze was solving using intensive recursive methods that search every path to find the way out. This project game better understanding of 2D arrays and how to unitize recursive algorithms. In addition it has thought me how efficiency in debugging and refracturing code.
